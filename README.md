# Bevy Snake Example

An example of the classic snake game in bevy and rust, updated to bevy-0.14.0.

Heavy inspiration from [Marcus' Blog](https://mbuffett.com/posts/bevy-snake-tutorial/). However, this version relies on
bevy-0.7.0, and is largely out of date. The [unofficial bevy cheatbook](https://bevy-cheatbook.github.io/introduction.html)
resolved these issues and was a massive help.
